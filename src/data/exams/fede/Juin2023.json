      "text": "Confronting the Growing Drought Risk\n\nDrought may be an ancient scourge, but it is getting worse. No region or country today is immune to its effects. Southern Europe is in the grip of a severe drought – the worst in 70 years for Italy. In the western United States, the past two decades have been the driest in 1,200 years. Owing to climate change and land degradation, droughts are becoming more frequent, more severe, and more widespread. In the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia are recording their fourth consecutive year without rains, and the situation has grown increasingly dire for people, livestock, and the ecosystems that support them. Owing to a lack of adequate nutrition, children are dying from diseases they would ordinarily survive. Even camels – which typically survive longer than people or other animal species – are dropping dead in large numbers across this region. River discharge in multiple countries is severely affected, with water volumes also depleted. Altogether, this may require extraordinary water and energy management measures to be taken in affected countries.\n\nThe lack of precipitation means soil water content has reduced significantly. This has made it harder for plants to extract water from the soil, leading to widespread stress on vegetation. This lack of water is also reducing or suspending hydroelectric and thermoelectric power production operations across countries. In summary, drought conditions and water scarcity are affecting energy production and reducing crop yield.\n\nThe unfavourable forecasts for the coming months may compromise the water supply and will likely keep the competition for this resource high. While drought mitigation strategies are of the utmost importance now, so is tackling the root cause of the problem: climate change and its disruption of the planet's water cycle. Further efforts are needed also for preventively adapting to the changing weather patterns by climate-proofing energy supply and applying sustainable solutions in agriculture. Building national and regional risk-management systems that can endure what is coming will require political will and significantly more international cooperation.",

      "text": "Elon Musk's deal to buy Twitter is in peril\n\nElon Musk's deal to buy Twitter is in serious jeopardy, three people familiar with the matter say, as Musk's camp concluded that Twitter's figures on spam accounts are not verifiable. Musk's team has stopped engaging in certain discussions around funding for the $44 billion deal, including with a party named as a likely backer, one of the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ongoing discussions. Talks with investors have cooled in recent weeks as Musk's camp has raised doubts about the recent data \"fire hose\" — a trove of data sold to corporate customers — they received from Twitter. Musk's team's doubts about the spam figures signal they believe they do not have enough information to evaluate Twitter's prospects as a business, the people said.\n\nNow that Musk's team has concluded it cannot verify Twitter's figures on spam accounts, one of the people said, it is expected to take potentially drastic action. The person said it was likely a change in direction from Musk's team would come soon, though they did not say exactly what they thought that change would be.\n\nThe spam accounts are not the only reason Musk might try to wriggle out of the deal. Twitter's share price has fallen dramatically since his takeover bid in April, leading to the impression that he is overpaying. And Musk also runs two other major companies, Tesla and SpaceX, along with some start-ups.\n\nBut the terms of the deal mean it wouldn't be easy for Musk to walk away. Musk has agreed to complete it unless something major happens to Twitter's business, and legal experts doubt the bot issue would qualify. Twitter, which initially fought Musk's takeover bid, would be a weaker company if the deal falls apart than when Musk first bought a stake, and experts expect Twitter to fight to get it done. Twitter itself has said it intends to complete the deal. Even if Musk convinces a judge to let him walk away, he could still be on the hook for the deal's $1 billion breakup fee.",
