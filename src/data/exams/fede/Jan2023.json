      "text": "Amazon Returns to Growth but Signals Slowness Ahead\n\nThe e-commerce giant, which also turned a profit in its latest quarter, indicated sales in the holiday period might rise at their lowest level since 2001. For much of this year, Amazon's growth slowed, and losses mounted as it faced high costs and changes in people's shopping habits with the ebbing of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn Thursday, the e-commerce giant signaled that its business was rebounding. At the same time, Amazon projected that sales might slow to as low as 2 percent in the current quarter, which includes the vital holiday shopping season. Those estimates, which fell far short of Wall Street's expectations, include a forecast that the strong U.S. dollar will continue to depress international sales.\n\nThe results come amid a rocky patch for tech giants. Microsoft, Meta and others have indicated in their earnings this week that tough days may be ahead. Shares of Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent of Google, also have declined this week. \"We are seeing signs all around that people's budgets are tight, inflation is still high, energy costs are an additional layer,\" Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's finance chief, said on a call with reporters. \"We are preparing for what could be a slower growth period.\"\n\nHe added that demand was particularly weakening in Europe, where inflation and rising fuel costs from the war in Ukraine have affected consumers. Prices are rising, but the volume of items selling is falling, said Guru Hariharan, whose company, CommerceIQ, advises large consumer brands that sell products on Amazon. \"That is a very concerning trend,\" he said.\n\nAfter two years of breakneck expansion, Amazon has spent much of this year putting on the brakes. Andy Jassy, who took over as chief executive last year, has moved to swiftly cut costs after the company overbuilt in anticipation of an extended pandemic-fueled boom in e-commerce. Amazon has curtailed plans to open warehouses and worked to improve the efficiency of its fulfillment operations, and it imposed a hiring freeze for corporate and technology roles for its retail division.",

      "text": "China's Latest Covid Lockdown Affects a Major iPhone Factory\n\nAn outbreak in Zhengzhou has sent an unknown number of workers at the city's Foxconn plant into quarantine. It's a bad time of year for output of iPhones to slow down. Foxconn, a major manufacturer for Apple, confirmed in a statement to The New York Times on Thursday that a \"small number of employees\" had been asked to quarantine, but declined to comment on details of the outbreak.\n\nFoxconn, with headquarters in Taiwan, said efforts to control the outbreak were \"progressing steadily\" and that the quarantined employees were being provided with what they needed, including \"material supplies, psychological comfort and responsive feedback.\"\n\nThe outbreak comes at an inopportune time for Apple and Foxconn, which is now making the new iPhone 14. Foxconn said that production and operations were \"relatively stable,\" and that output estimates for the three-month period from October to December would \"remain unchanged.\"\n\nThis part of the year is typically a critical period for iPhones. Last year, roughly a third of the $192 billion in iPhone sales was generated in the holiday period alone, according to Apple. The phone helped enhance total revenue by 8 percent in the latest quarter, the company reported on Thursday.\n\nApple has moved production of some of its next-generation iPhones to India, a shift in response to growing awareness of heightened risks caused by concentrating manufacturing in a single country.\n\nThe Zhengzhou city government said that neighborhoods in several of the city's 12 districts are under some form of restrictions.\n\nCalled \"iPhone City\" by locals, Zhengzhou is a city of six million people in inland China. It is a central artery in Apple's manufacturing of the iPhone, producing roughly half of Apple's global supply, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, a financial services group.\n\n\"What happens if this hits other Chinese cities where Apple has supply chains?\" he said. \"It's definitely something that Apple needs to consider in the mid-to-long term.\"",
